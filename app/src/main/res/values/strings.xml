    <string name="dev_description_text">Surrounded by bleeding edge technology and developing for the future.
        \n\n My current focus is in Android mobile development. I\'m tinkering with the future of VR while
        continuing to gain experience in the Android space. In the past I have developed for Chromecast,
        Android Wear, Android games, and an Android for Auto application for BMW. I\'m currently developing internal
        Android apps for State Farm as well as playing with the always growing list of side projects.
        \n\nI started my own company, Damos Designs, to put myself through school without having to take out student loans.
        I\'ve designed promotional graphics for organizations across the country.
        \n\nMotivated. Passionate. Persistent.</string>
